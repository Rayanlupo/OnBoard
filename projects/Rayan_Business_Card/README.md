# Rayan's businesss card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I've projected a business card that uses a NFC to send my contacts to someone
it has a dynamic QR code in case the phone is not compatible with NFC

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$29.25
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
it has been hard to find the right drawing to customise it
